# Magic Star Save File Editor
A Super Mario 64 Save File Editor Written in C++
Check out the latest windows exe. release in the "Releases" tab on the Magic Star Save File Editor Repository.

Opens up your Mario 64 .eep save files and allows you to edit the amount of stars per level, coin scores. Also allows you to unlock doors and secret castle items and areas.

Please notify me of any bugs you might encounter.

Currently only Coded the First Slot of the save, I will get to the other 3 in time. I advise you to copy your existing file/files that you don't want to modify/edit to one of the 3 other slots and modify the first slot to your liking. Unless of course the slot you wish to mod/edit happens to be the First slot, then just edit away.
The Magic Star Editor will not affect your other save slots. But you can freely copy the First slot over to any other slot after editing it.

if you're trying to compile the source code please let me know as i have not uploaded the project files, only the source files.
Please note that you will need the Microsoft Foundation Clasess if you want to modify the UI in any way.
also if you're trying to use some of my source code - please ask.

If you have any other questions or suggestions, please message me. Thank You.

David G. Barron
